Update the installed package and cache on your instance 
sudo yum update -y:
install the most recent Docker community Edition Package
sudo yum install -y docker:      #2023 linux
Start the Docker service
sudo service docker start:
sudo service docker status:
Add the ec2-user to the docker group do that you can run Docker commands without using sudo
sudo useradd ec2-docker: # adding a user
sudo usermod -a -G docker ec2-user:
groups ec2-docker: use this command to verify if the user was added to grou # result: ec2-docker docker
pick up the new docker group permission by logging back in again. close the current SSH terminal window and reconnect to your instance in a new one. your new ssh session should have the appropriate docker group persion

verify that the ec2-user can run Docker commands without using sudo
exit: #exit and log back
groups:   it should show you the docker group you belong
ls -l /var/run/docker.sock: check permission and ownership of docker socket
sudo systemctl restart docker: restart docker service
docker ps: test this command to use docker command without sudo
Run some images

docker run hello-world:
docker run -it ubuntu bash: after it runs, exit 
dock run -d --name my-container nginx:
docker images: show all the images
docker ps: show running containers
docker stop my-container: stops container
docker rm my-container: removes the container
docker pull alpine: pull an image from Docker Hub.




Running containtainers:
docker run[options]Image[commands][argument]
docker run --help # give you arguments like  "i" for interaction, 'T' for a particular versio tag EG "docker run -it ubuntu:24.10"
"docker run -it ubuntu:24.10"
docker ps #allows us to view the containers status
docker images # lists out all the docker image
docker start/stop/restart # start and stop a spefied image[specify the image ID]
docker rm/rmi  # Remove a container/Removes an image[conteiner befor image. make sure it is not running]


docker run --help # to get aguements
docker ps -a #shows all the containers [-a means all ]
docker images # shows all the images 
docker run -it pyhthon # for example, i= interact, t= tag


dockerile: Dockerfile

FROM: specfy the image as a base
RUN: use to execute some commands
Copy: copy from your local to the container
CMD: what to execute when our containers startup{argument}
ENTRYPOINT: same as CMD but cannot be override
example

#base image
FROM fedora
#command to run
LABEL maintenace: "bo"
LABEL description: "this dockerfile install and manage apache"
RUN yum -y update
RUN yum install -y httpd
#copy the index file to the container
COPY index.html /var/www/html
#place to add systemctl and start
EXPOSE 80

#start  container with httpd and this is the command start httpd
ENTRYPOINT [ "usr/sbin/httpd"]
CMD ["-D", "FOREGROUND"]

#go back to your ec2 and copy Docfile, and index.html

vi Dockerfile
vi index.html
docker build -t bo_apache_image:v1.0.0 .  #(pwd is represented by ".")
docker run -it -p80:80 bo_apache_image:v1.0.0 # test public ip on the browser
exit with contol +c # once you exit, it would not work on the browser.
docker run -dit -p80:80 bo_apache_image:v1.0.0 # this would allow u interact wih the browser
 

HOW TO PUSH THE IMAGE TO DOCKER HUB repo:

Docker login # logging into docker resgistry 
 -user name:
 -password:
Docker tag # tagging the image
 -Docker images:
 -docker tage image ID Bo_apache_image:v1.0.1: (copy the image id)
 -docker images:
Docker push # push to docker repository
 -docker push Bo_apache_image:v1.0.1:
Docker pull # retrieve to docker repository
  - docker --version:
  - docker pull Bo_apache_image:v1.0.1:
  - docker run -dit -p80:80 Bo_apache_image:1.0.1:

test on the browser
  - localhost: or
  - curl localhost:80:
